# memories

This project has been created from scratched and follows the MVC pattern (Model, View, Controller).

The database along with the triggers and stored procedures have been created from scratch using the SQL Langage available here :
[SQL Queries to build the Database](https://github.com/ultimecreation/memories/blob/master/src/controllers/DbSetupController.php)

The styling has been done in row CSS with Sass (no librairies like bootstrap used)

I've added some Gamifications features to make the project more appealing for the users

- The owner can sell advertising spaces
- The sponsors can buy credits using Paypal
- the users can earn points that they can redeem to publish Guest articles
